## API Key

Include your API key in every request using the \`X-API-Key\` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.shapeshift.com/v1/chains" \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_your_api_key_here"
```

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secret.** Never expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or browser requests. Use environment variables and server-side proxies.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables" icon="key">
    Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it:

    ```bash .env
    SHAPESHIFT_API_KEY=sk_live_your_api_key_here
    ```

    ```javascript
    const client = new ShapeShiftClient({
      apiKey: process.env.SHAPESHIFT_API_KEY,
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Server-side only" icon="server">
    Always make API calls from your server, never from the browser. If you need to expose swap data to your frontend, create a proxy endpoint on your server.

    ```javascript
    // Server-side (Express example)
    app.get('/api/rates', async (req, res) => {
      const rates = await shapeshift.swap.getRates(req.query);
      res.json(rates);
    });

    // Never in the browser
    // fetch('https://api.shapeshift.com/v1/swap/rates', {
    //   headers: { 'X-API-Key': 'sk_live_...' }
    // });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Periodically rotate your API keys via the developer portal. If you suspect a key has been compromised, revoke it immediately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate-limited to **100 requests per minute** per API key. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a \`429 Too Many Requests\` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RATE_LIMITED",
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait and try again."
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic to handle rate limiting gracefully.
</Tip>

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

Returned when the API key is missing or invalid:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
  }
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the API key doesn't have permissions for the requested resource:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "API key does not have access to this resource"
  }
}
```
